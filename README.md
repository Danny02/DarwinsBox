=============
My little toolbox which I use for developing game related stuff.
The goal is to build a wide range of utility and framework code which is needed for 3D - OpenGL Applications. I also try to use good software engineering practices.

Some stuff:
- general model writer reader framework
- little shader "scripting"/"usage" framework
- 3D Math libary
- a lot of OpenGL utility 
- JOpenCTM

stuff to come(ideas)
- perfect :) resource managment framework
- resource compilation/build tools
- webGl crosscompiler(based on GWT)
